# Binomial model

Your assignment, due in two weeks, is to create a Python applicaiton that
prices both American and European options using a CRR binomial tree.

Your calculator must accept all the inputs noted in earlier slides.

The output must include the price of the option (call and put) and all the
Greek values associated with the option.

**The only control flow statement you may use is “if”. NO loops**
**allowed**. Refer to Implementing Derivative Models for more information.

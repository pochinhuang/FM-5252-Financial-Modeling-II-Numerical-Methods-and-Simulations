# Assignment

Your assignment, due in two weeks, is to implement a Monte Carlo
simulator in C#. The simulator must meet the following specifications.

1. Calculate the price of European calls and puts
2. Calculate Greeks associated with the calls and puts
3. Calculate the standard error of the simulation
4. Permit the user a choice in number of steps and number of simulations

Presumably, your project will need some rudimentary terminal-based
interface to set parameters of the simulation.
